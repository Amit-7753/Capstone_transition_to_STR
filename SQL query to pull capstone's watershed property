One of capstone's client - watershedhas agreed to use his 244 properties for short term rentals as he is also curious.
We will extract all of 244 property data from 'capstone' database using SQL and combine those data and prepare table with 244 rows of data.

SQL queries:

SHOW tables FROM capstone;
# Tables are location, property_type, st_property_info, st_rental_dates, st_rental_prices, watershed_property_info.
SHOW columns from location;
SHOW columns from property_type;
SHOW columns from st_property_info;
SHOW columns from st_rental_dates;
SHOW columns from st_rental_prices;
SHOW columns from watershed_property_info;

# Now combining all tables to extract only watershed properties and save it in csv file for excel.

Capstone_data=SELECT DISTINCT w.ws_property_id, w.location, w.property_type, w.current_monthly_rent, srp.percentile_10th_price, srp.percentile_90th_price, \
srp.sample_nightly_rent_price, srd.rental_date, srd.st_property, COUNT(srd.rental_date)/365 AS occupancy_rate, p.apt_house, p.num_bedrooms, p.kitchen, p.shared, l.city, l.state,l.zipcode \
FROM watershed_property_info w JOIN st_property_info spi ON \
(w.location=spi.location AND w.property_type=spi.property_type) JOIN st_rental_prices srp ON \
(spi.location=srp.location AND spi.property_type=srp.property_type) JOIN property_type p ON \
w.property_type=p.property_type_id JOIN location l ON w.location=l.location_id JOIN st_rental_dates srd ON \
spi.st_property_id = srd.st_property WHERE YEAR(srd.rental_date)=2015 GROUP BY srd.st_property limit 5;
file.csv('dwn.csv');

Capstone_data.csv('Capstone_data.csv')

#Following this query we have now extracted 244 rows of capstone's watershed data which i have uploaded.
